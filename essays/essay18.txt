Columbia Business School is located in the heart of
the world's business capital - Manhattan. How do
you anticipate that New York City will impact your
experience at Columbia? (Maximum 250 words)
To be a dynamic leader who leverages capital within the tech industry, I
need the perspective that only New York City can provide. Attending
events such as New York Technology Week or the Cloud Solutions forum
will help me learn new perspectives on the future of the industry and
connect with energy leaders. I especially look forward to the annual talk
on game-changing developments in the Big Data and analytics industry
such as Wolfram Alpha’s computational framework or friction-free online
shopping.

NYC will also provide the innovation resources I need to find new ways to
leverage my start up as a competitive value. Having local access to
people like Jenny Tang of Jump Associates, who specializes in taking new
ideas to the market, will give me an opportunity to discuss ways to drive
innovation within the risk-adverse software industry.

Many NYC non-profits share my passion for providing access to safe
sustainable food. I want to work with “project: food” and its passionate
founder, Ronald Clarkson, to help them more efficiently provide
sustainable farming solutions by applying the lessons I have learned in the
Peace Corps around working with local communities and governments to
ensure project sustainability. Through events such as the NYC
International Food Forum, I will leave CBS with the skills to implement
programs that add both social and business value. I look forward to the
plethora of opportunities presented by NYC, and will take advantage of
them to be a leader in the tech, innovation, and social impact sectors.

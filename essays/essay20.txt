When my parents were laid off from small, state-owned factories during
the Chinese economic reform in 1990s, we had to borrow money for
living expenses. This experience is why I desire to improve China's money
flow to vitalize industries and individual companies as a portfolio
strategist at a sovereign wealth fund like CIC.

As a risk manager for Citigroup and DBS Bank over the past 5 years, I’ve
learned how money runs the economy, witnessed passionate
entrepreneurs get rejected for bank loans, and understood the tight
connection between a bank’s operational risk and its product strategy. I
am committed to devising better strategies to fund small businesses in
China.

The difficulties I faced growing up, and being consistently challenged by
front-office sales in my risk management role, is why I pursue leadership
roles, challenge the status quo and face obstacles. In university, I
arranged more than 20 activities for the student union. In my role at DBS,
I worked closely with the VP in Consumer Banking to achieve a 35%
reduction in operational loss for the department, and even encouraged
colleagues to work out in the gym. At Emory, I’ll take a leadership role in
Finance Club, where I can organize an exchange of ideas between bankers,
consultants, and industry elites. I can also promote cross-industry learning
in course work, and strengthen the communication between Chinese and
U.S. students through clubs, projects, and recreational activities.

By connecting with 10,000 Goizueta alumni, I will be part of a global
family post-MBA. Keeping in touch with alumni working in key industries
like TMT and FMCG in China will allow me to make informed investment
decisions. I would like to be an alumni mentor to offer financial industry
insights and provide career advice to future students.

Over the past year, I have gained a better understanding of Booth
through information sessions and interactions with alumni and current
students, and confirmed Booth is the best place for me to realize my
career ambition.

I talked with Jenny Shao, ’13, my former colleague at Vestax, about my
career plan, and she felt strongly that I would benefit from the Polsky
Center for Entrepreneurship. Chicago Booth greatly emphasizes
Entrepreneurship, which is now the second-largest concentration, and the
Polsky Center is the best place for me to test my entrepreneurial ideas in
real-world settings. The Polsky Center contributes to the regional
business community by providing assistance to emerging entrepreneurs,
small businesses, and social ventures, which is exactly my career pursuit—
creating a social impact by setting up a consulting firm specializing on
local small enterprises.

In a Booth Coffee Chat this summer, Mary Nguyen, ’12, told me Booth
increased her international exposure, and she highly recommended I take
full advantage of the International Business Exchange Program, which
covers 26 partner schools in 17 countries. A global horizon is crucial for
me to apply advanced business models from other parts of the world into
China.

I look forward to gaining experience in another culture, studying business
issues from another perspective, building a global network, and preparing
for my future career.

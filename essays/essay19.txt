I am currently building on my nine highly productive years at Samuel &
Leftman and honing my abilities in corporate management to take the
next step towards becoming a CFO. Pursuing a Booth evening MBA will
allow me to apply my education to my current position at Seneley, and
continue developing my skill set moving forward.

My desire to obtain a Booth MBA began when I moved to Chicago to begin
my career at S&L. Through three years in the audit practice and two
years overseas, I led large multi-national client projects, securing three
promotions. I then worked in the intense and highly competitive
Transaction Recommendation practice, consulting on more than 40
private equity and corporate M&A transactions including Foxcom’s $23
billion acquisition of Rem Circuitry.

Subsequently, I took my current senior financial management position at a
local manufacturer to hone my abilities in corporate management and
round out my skill set. That’s where a Booth MBA comes in: my employer
(Seneley) strongly supports my pursuit of an MBA and appreciates the
value it adds to the company, committing to fully sponsor my degree.
Having graduated from your part-time MBA program in 1989, my
supervisor speaks enthusiastically of Booth’s contribution to his success.
While I developed robust project management, accounting and corporate
finance skills at S&L, and am bolstering long-term corporate management
skills at Seneley, a Booth MBA will broaden my skill set in marketing,
strategy development, communications and M&A financing – all essential
as I pursue my plan to become a more comprehensive strategic business
professional, and rise through the ranks at Seneley. It will enable me to
help Seneley achieve its strategic growth objectives and prepare for the
day when I will be called upon to step into the most important financial
role of a company – that of CFO.

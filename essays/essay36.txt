Check. A 14-year-old Laotian boy in the mountain town of Thakhek was
one move from beating me at chess. By now I had worked in remote
regions from Zimbabwe to Bhutan, but I had been cruising with an air of
superiority. Sure, these people were generous, I thought, but I can think
critically. At this moment, the evidence that had been mounting against
me came tumbling down, burying me in my assumptions. As he moved his
queen into position, I realized that I was not at all intellectually superior to
the “simple” people in the developing world.

Previously, it was easy to dismiss Tibetan rice famers as kind, simple
people. However, these same farmers managed to explain why the
Maoists are favored in the rural areas of the country in ways that The
Economist failed. With my mind open, I had my own customs challenged,
like why we light fires on pastries during birthdays, why we reward people
for talents randomly distributed at birth, and whether the majority should
always have its say. While this mental shift was initially daunting, I found a
world rich with perspectives. I started to do a lot less talking and much
more listening.

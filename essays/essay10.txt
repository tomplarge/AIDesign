I’m amazing at picking clothes and styling hair truth be told, I’m better
than my girlfriend and when we attend important events, I help her out.
Outside work, I organize free workshops where I teach students to dress
up for job interviews. I wanted to help them land their dream job by
showing them how to create modern, professional looks. I really get a kick
out of seeing their astonished reactions when they see how amazing they
look! I hope this skill can add color to CBS, and I look forward to providing
hair and costume support for extracurricular activities like CBS Follies.

I’m also a huge basketball fan who coaches a junior team in a local
tournament. Most kids spend their entire summer in front of computer
games, and it is important to me to show them how pursuing goals can be
fun. Some say kids are too young to learn advanced tactics and they
should just follow their natural instincts, but I love giving those kids a
chance to learn sophisticated techniques to test their potential. This
summer, I showed them how to position themselves, cut into spaces and
organize their defense. Witnessing their improvement week by week, I felt
so proud that they were both learning and having fun. These tactics
turned us into a dynamite team and with some luck, we actually won the
tournament, a memory none of us will ever forget.

So here I am: a basketball fanatic who is amazing at styling hair. You don’t
see that every day!

I can see it now: I’m in the heart of New York, business capital of the
world. To my right a venture capitalist ready to fund my projects, to my
left my future partner in my company. This is what I’ll gain from
Columbia’s unique cluster system and student clubs.

With more club activities than any other leading school, Columbia is the
perfect environment to launch my dreams. The Healthcare Industry
Association (HCIA) will expand my horizons by inviting outside speakers
to discuss a variety of related issues. Specifically, for 2011’s annual
conference, co-organized by HCIA and the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical
Management Program (HPM), I’m particularly interested in the Venture
Capital and Entrepreneurship Panel, Emerging Markets Panel and Medical
Technologies Panel. I’m also thrilled to hear from executives including
Amelia Lobos, Vice President of Strategy from Boston Hospitals, and
Takashi Sito, Marketing Officer from HenchHealth.

Taking a leading role, I intend to initiate the first student-led HCIA panel
forum among members with previous healthcare industry experience, in
order to share knowledge among my fellow students. As a speaker, I will
discuss my professional experience running my CRO, and intriguing stories
of innovative start-ups in Champaign, Illinois. Products I intend to discuss
include drug-distributing bandage coating, fiberglass tissues to substitute
collagen as biomedical material, and new specialty pharmaceuticals with
unique controlled-release technology, all of which I helped invent.
With these plans and my strong track record in Healthcare, I hope to
become a valued member of the CBS community.

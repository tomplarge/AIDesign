My first trip to Manila in 2011 was also my first time working closely with
a Filipino team. Meeting to discuss an action plan for a new project, I sat
at the head of a conference table and asked the team questions about
their expertise, background, and expectations. I directed most of the
questions at Ryan, the team leader, who was shaking and his voice
trembling when he spoke.

After the meeting, I pulled Ryan aside and spoke candidly about my
observations. He told me that he was unaccustomed to this type of
meeting. Because it was our first encounter, Ryan wasn’t prepared to
suddenly work so hands-on with a foreign stranger, and it wasn’t the
cultural norm to put him on the spot so quickly. I felt guilty yet
determined to correct the situation. I needed to defuse the tension and
ensure that cultural differences would not interfere with our impending
work.

Amidst the ensuing 12-hour workdays, I organized several team outings
that allowed us to bond outside of work. I learned that Ryan works best
when he is prepared in advance, so I made sure to meet with him
separately before holding team meetings. Ryan and I scheduled daily
check-ins, so he was prepared and not caught off guard. Doing this
ultimately helped me gain Ryan’s trust and respect, which contributed to
the success of this project. More importantly, I learned that building
rapport and trust amongst colleagues is the best way to create
professional, cross-cultural relationships.

Pursuing an MBA in New York City will allow me to build invaluable
connections with industry leaders, enhancing both my professional and
personal development.
As part of the Health Care Industry Association, I will attend the
Healthcare Career Supercharger to network with industry leaders like
Marcus Danielson and Fritz Firestone, the chairmen of HCA and C.A.R.E.
Additionally, I will join the Management Consulting Association and
leverage Columbia's unique relationships with giants like Deloitte and Bain
to facilitate my transition into consulting. Specifically, I will utilize the CBS
online alumni database to connect with members of Columbia's 40,000
strong alumni network and build relationships with alumni currently living
in New York and working at Bain and other consultancies.

NYC will also develop my leadership and strategic planning skills through
community-focused interest groups. As an undergraduate I was heavily
involved with NYC organizations spanning issues like social justice,
education in rural Namibia and opportunities for women. As a strong
advocate of womenâ€™s empowerment, I will join the Columbia Women in
Business Club (CWIB) where in addition to taking advantage of the career
services on offer, I hope to establish a mentorship program in the Bronx
dedicated to providing disadvantaged young women with academic,
career and life guidance from successful female role models.
Furthermore, I will balance my academic and professional endeavors by
exploring NYC's hidden secrets. Among my favorites is the Namaste, a
speakeasy yoga studio combining my passions for yoga, vegan food, and
helping small businesses.

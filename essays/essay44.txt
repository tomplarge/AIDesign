Last year, I was assigned to oversee the production of an 8-minute
customer video prepared for the Nasdaq–listed Miravira.com’s Annual
General Meeting (AGM). Three months earlier, the company’s CEO stepped
down after a massive fraud scandal on the e-commerce platform.

In two weeks, I visited 29 small businesses in 10 cities with an in-house
camera crew of 5 people. While I received my share of positive and
glowing testimonials, there were also many customers who were
downright angry and critical of our business. During the editing process,
conflict emerged. While I was planning to include the negative comments
in the video the project manager was concerned about the demoralizing
impact because all the videos we made before were so positive.

Although I was nervous about the consequence, I felt confident in my
decision to include the customer criticism. Those sharp comments
effectively captured the challenges we were facing. If we were to become
a company that is a respected company we should at least have the
courage to admit our own problems. I structured the video so that it
included a portion of customer criticism followed by the part where
customers expressed their confidence in the company.

My palms were sweating when we showed the video to Jeffrey Hernandez,
our chairman. “Very good!” Jeffrey said, “that honesty is exactly what we
need to hear.” The video was well received by the investors and
employees at the meeting and was later viewed over 7,000 times in the
company’s internal forum. “Inspiring!” was the most common response
from our colleagues. After this experience, I know that burying my head in
the sand will never solve the problem while being honest is always the
best policy.

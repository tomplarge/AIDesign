In college, I joined many student associations and community activities. I
was the soccer player in accounting department team, the supervisor of
approvals department of student government, and the director of
Outdoor Survival Camp. I also became financially independent and had to
work many part time jobs to afford tuition, rent, and living expenses.
Some of my classmates, who planned to study abroad after graduation,
chose a particular professorâ€™s course to get easy scores. However, I took
a different route: several challenging courses, unfortunately resulting in
relatively lower grades.

As a freshman, the first time living away from parents, everything was
novel and exciting. I became absorbed in my extracurricular activities, and
this led to bad time management. I neglected my studies and lowered my
GPA. But I am grateful for this lesson.

Learning from this mistake, I did great at my GMAT (750, and full score in
quantitative section) and I enhanced my professional accounting skills
through self-study. My abilities were acknowledged during my first job at
YCMB, where I led a team as early as my third year (1 year ahead of
schedule).

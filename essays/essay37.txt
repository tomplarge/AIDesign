In Sweden, I joined fika to get to know my team at IKEA. Fika means
coffee break in Swedish, which is a pivotal daily activity of Swedes. There
are two fikas in a day, each 15 minutes long. It was a good chance to
learn about local culture and colleagues’ private life.

However, as a lead consultant and a foreigner from an all-business culture,
I decreased my time with fika group to get more work done. Furthermore,
I hoped to set an example for those who ‘over-fika’ed’.

To my surprise, the work I finished during fika time was cited negatively
by one of the consultants as “Japanese express service.” Most of my
colleagues told me that I put unnecessary pressure on them and I should
learn to relax. They called me “running-boy” because I run to the coffee
machine and then back to my desk again.

My action unfortunately drew a line between working hard and creating a
harmonized working environment. I had an open talk with the others
about working cultures, personal values, and societal norms. I explained
that we were falling behind our deliverable schedules and it felt like
lengthy fika may have been part of the problem. However, I also
expressed to the team my understanding of fika and promised I would join
twice a week. Surprisingly, my colleagues added discussions around
improving workplace productivity to the usual idle chat during fika,
efficiency measures that have since increased work completed by 15%
daily.

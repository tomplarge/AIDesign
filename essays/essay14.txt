1. I've completed several ultra-marathons.
2. I taught myself how to read and write Japanese by watching Japanese
dramas.
3. I'm a cocktail aficionado who can’t mix drinks.

Which is the lie?

Number one is true. Every year, I run 108 miles from Queens to the tip of
Long Island, a multi-day mental and physical challenge reminding me that I
can accomplish anything, from closing a 20-million dollar deal to launching
my own company.

Number two is also true. Despite being a native Japanese speaker with
strong ties to my cultural roots, I am embarrassed to say that I couldn't
actually read Kanji until my teens. In eighth grade however, I became
addicted to the thrill of Japanese dramas and saw a perfect learning
opportunity. I watched every episode with subtitles, memorizing
characters that I didn't recognize. Later, my self-taught Japanese got me
hired by Toshiba, and I now view everything I do as another learning
opportunity.

Number three is… a lie! While I am most definitely a fan of good
cocktails, I'm proud to say that I'm also quite the bartender! My travels
along with my passion for learning about new drinks have fueled my
interest in bartending. From old fashions to the latest cosmos, I love
experimenting with international ingredients and have even launched my
own blog “The Undercover Bartender” to share my creations. Perhaps I’ll
share my latest recipes as a member of the CBS Wine and Spirits Club!
